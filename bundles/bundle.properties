## objectives

crater.text4 = Connect drills with core using conveyors, get 15 palladium into the core.
crater.text5 = Oh no, it seems like [#8a73c6]enemy patrol[] has found you, quickly build a [#b5b5b5]penetrate turret[].
crater.text6 = Okay that was easy, but that does not mean they will stop. They found you, and they know that you are a bit powerful.
crater.text7 = Also there is a little problem.. The [red]core[] thrusters are not working anymore.
crater.text8 = We need to build another [red]core[], somewhere. Try to make materials for it.
